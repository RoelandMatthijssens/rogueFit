			The goal of the application is to give people a better motivation to work out. 
		\paragraph{}
			When a person decides to work out for the first time he will be motivated to keep going to the gym, step on the bicycle, go run in the park, go swim on a regular basis, etc. This initial motivation will wear of after some time. Especially when there are no directly noticable improvements in weight loss, muscle gain, etc.
		\paragraph{}
			At some point it might become routine to do the workout until something gets in the way and breaks the routine. It might be getting to cold to go running in the morning, the person might get ill for a couple consecutive days, something personal may happen. After this brief interuption from routine it is very likely that the person will not pick up his good habbit where he left off.
